# Rabduction!

A simple tile climbing game using bevy.

At the moment, I'm trying to get the core game working.
Later on, as I learn more about bevy and game development in general, I plan to make this a complete
game with sprites, audio, menus and maybe even levels!

The name **Rabduction!** comes from (R)ust + a similar old-school Android game called
[Abduction!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.phil&hl=en_IN&gl=US)
